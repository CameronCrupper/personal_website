                        I have always wanted to work with computers. I took a workshop as a kid where we got to build our own computers, and then with them got to build our own website. I still remember that bright green background I used that I was so excited about because it was different from anything I had seen before. In Highschool I took a C++ class and built a simple version of the game TRON as one of my projects so my friends and I could play it after class.
                    </p>

                    <p class="attention-getter">
                        From there I put my all into jobs that weren’t going to take me where I wanted to go; doing what I could to survive in the world. Saying that though, I’ve always had a great work ethic and no matter what job I was at I did it to the absolute best of my abilities. I did everything from Pizza Delivery, Compounding Technician, Accounting, and Hospice Medication Delivery, which was one of my favorite for the level of compassion and care I could provide to another person.

                        I remember one day our rent increased and our finances got just a little too tight for comfort. I had reached a point where I knew I wanted something more in my life, so I did something about it. “Success usually comes to those who are too busy looking for it.” – Henry David Thoreau. Now I’m here and I am ready to keep going. I’ve recently graduated from Holberton Tulsa, and while there I obtained a solid understanding of Python, C, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Flutter and React. I plan to keep going. I’m here for Fullstack Web Development, the continuation of that childhood dream.

                            using any language. We had just learned basic Python and I had always
                            love creating games, so we came up with BlawesomeTree.py. You control a
                            basket and fruits will randomly spawn while you attempt to catch as many
                            as possible. We only had 5 days to create it and working with a bunch
                            of new python features was very challenging but so much fun. Some
                            of the features include the basket staying within the screen parameters,
                            a scoreboard, randomization of fruit locations and the speeds they fall
                            at, music (copyright free of course), and it will print to the console
                            an incrementing number every time you score. We both had a great time
                            creating this game and I’ll probably create another different game
                            with Pygame in the future. Please enjoy BlawesomeTree.py. To run it
                            you need an IDE we used VScode and Python, clone the repository and
                            run blawesome_tree.py. In the command line Change directory to
                            HackSprintBlossom and the enter ./blawesome_tree.py or you can go to the link
                            and play it that way.

                            They have a new product and they need a responsive website built for them in
                            order to market it online; they know you’ve got just the right skill set to
                            craft their vision. Secretive as they are, they have decided to NOT give you
                            details about their company, nor give you details on the product they are
                            selling. Instead, they hand over to you a simple sentence, which they want
                            you to interpret, in order to build the best possible responsive website for
                            them to use as a marketing tool. The sentence they give you is: “Waves”) and
                            5 days to create a custom frontend website from scratch.
                            I’m really proud of the work I was able to get done on this by myself in such
                            a short amount of time and I think it reflects my learning from the frontend
                            section of course work. This was also my first time working with Tailwind
                            and not CSS so I was pretty pleased with the results, and I hope you are too.

                        <p>
                            This app was created as our final project at Holberton Tulsa. We
                            came up with every aspect of this app ourselves from brainstorming
                            initial ideas to final app development. Our initial concept was
                            “it’s really difficult to decide what to have for dinner, especially
                            in a group of 2 or more”, so we created Let’s Eat.
                            It’s an app that allows you to input preferences for types of food
                            (American, Asian, Mexican, BBQ, etc.) invite friends into a group
                            and return a restaurant that gives the highest score between everyone
                            in the group within a certain distance of the person who created
                            the group. This can also be accomplished with one person only
                            giving their preferences and finding a restaurant nearby that
                            returns the highest score. You start with a login page where you
                            can create a new account as long as it fits within certain
                            criteria or log in using an existing google account.
                            A homepage that displays your current
                            entered location as well as instructions for the app how many
                            friends you have and how many tables you are currently at.

                    Next is our friends list page where you can search and add friends.
                    A list of only avialable friends will be displayed and once a
                    friend is added they will be removed from the available pool. On your homepage
                    how many friends you have will be displayed. There is also a search function
                    that will display any name that matches its given search result.

                            We used a Yelp API that has over 200 options. So nothing should be missed. Setting
                            your preferences stores them on firebase and this was a situation we had to deal with
                            early on. There was a sight lag that we were able to fix so now the sliders move smoothly.
                            And it's one of my favorite pages now.

                                        An important part is setting your location so the API can find out where you
                                        actually are. You can view the currently set location on your homepage. Starting a "table" which is just the name we've given for a group you create, will allow you to invite any friends you have added
                            that are available from your friends list and create a table name for
                            your group. That table name will then be displayed on the Tables page.
                                    </p>

                                        Once you click on your created table you are able to then remove friends if
                                        necessary and search for your restaurant. The search will compare all friends
                                        ratings they have given to the different categories and return the option with the highest score
                                        within a 15 mile radius of the table creator.
